It goes to show that there is a golden sky at the end of the storm and getting past the storm is not impossible. I can confidently say that we may never see a better midfielder than Stevie in our lifetime.My biggest inspiration in music is Alexi “Wildchild” Laiho who is the lead singer in the band Children Of Bodom.

I started learning Guitar since I was 11 and I haven't looked back ever since. My obligations to college has made it difficult to continue learning it but I do manage to find some time in my daily schedule to practice, be it only for a couple of minutes. Favorite bands include Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, Messuggah and Disturbed.Besides that, I love playing and watching football.
